Refactor Weather Map App using Angular Services and ngRoute(for single page application)
 - WeatherMapApp using AngularJs, Google Maps API, AJax and AngularJs Services
 - displays a weather marker icon for the current weather (I have am array of ids that references a certain city)
 - if you click on the weather marker icon, you will get an info. window with more information for that city current weather
 - there is also a sidebar that list all the cites in my array, and its shows the weather marker icon, city name and and current temp.
 -detail page that gives you 5 day forecast for a particular city you select
